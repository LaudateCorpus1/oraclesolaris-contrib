# Oracle Solaris on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

Oracle Solaris is the trusted business platform that you depend on. The [Oracle Solaris 11](https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11/) Operating System (OS) gives you consistent compatibility, is simple to use and is designed to always be secure. 

Since August 2019, Oracle Solaris images are available on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) Marketplace for deployment as a Bare Metal image or as Virtual Machines on OCI. This directory provides you with step-by step instructions on the following:

- [Launching an Oracle Solaris Instance](Launch_Instance)
- [Utilizing OCI Storage Resources](Block_Storage)
- [Installing and Launching Oracle Solaris Zones](Oracle_Solaris_Zones)
