# Creating Oracle Solaris Zones 	

Oracle Solaris Zones although helps you consolidate multiple physical machines on a single system, they can also be launched as Non-Global Zone or a Kernel zone on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This [document](Creating_Oracle_Solaris_Zones.md) walks you through the steps involved in configuring and launching Oracle Solaris Zones in OCI. For more information on Oracle Solaris Zones, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E53394_01/html/E54762/zones.intro-1.html#scrolltoc) here.
