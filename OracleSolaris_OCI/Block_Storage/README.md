# Utilizing Storage Resources on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Once you have successfully [launched an Oracle Solaris](OracleSolaris_OCI/Launch_Instance) instance, you would likely want to use other Oracle Cloud Storage resources to run your applications or deploy zones in Oracle Solaris. This document provides a [demonstration](Oracle Solaris 11.4 Utilizing storage resources on OCI.md) on how you can create and attach Block Volumes to your Oracle Solaris instance. For more information on types of storage resources available, please refer to the [OCI documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/home.htm).
